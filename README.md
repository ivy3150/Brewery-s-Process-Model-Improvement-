The business has employed several employees who take care of the procurement, manufacturing, distribution, and customer service. 

Project Objective: Resolve the problems of data management and improve the process flow, that is the efficiency of production and shipment, to reduce wasted time and costs.

Current Challenges: We need to reflect the current inventory levels and other information so that we can fulfill customers' demands immediately. Hence, it is important for the company to have a system to store the latest data.

Motivations: With the improvements, the company will be better able to take decisions on raw material procurements and inventory. It will in turn reduce procurement and inventory holding costs. In addition, the mechanism will help us serve customers better.
