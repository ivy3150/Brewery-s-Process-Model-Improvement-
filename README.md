PROJECT INTRO:

Business Overview: Mars Brew Co. is a local small batch brewery. It serves customers home crafted beers in a restaurant set-up. It is a single brewery that serves two product lines - IPA and Ale. The business has employed several employees who take care of the procurement, manufacturing, distribution, and customer service. 

Project Objective: Resolve the problems of data management and improve the process flow, that is the efficiency of production and shipment, to reduce wasted time and costs.

Current Challenges: We need to reflect the current inventory levels and other information so that we can fulfill customers' demands immediately. Hence, it is important for the company to have a system to store the latest data.

Motivations: With the improvements, the company will be better able to take decisions on raw material procurements and inventory. It will in turn reduce procurement and inventory holding costs. In addition, the mechanism will help us serve customers better. 

REFLECTION:

1. Favorite part of the project?

Our favorite part of the project was that it allowed us to combine everything we had learned in class and gave us a better understanding of how the various topics fit together and are applied in a business environment. The way that the project was broken down into phases helped us to build out our project, make corrections and receive feedback on how we could improve our ideas.

2. What did we learn most about the project?

Specifically building the ERD digram was one of the most challenging and beneficial learning components of the project. Looking into our process and determining how we would break down the information was a valuable experience and developing that understanding helped when we went to generate our reports.

3. What would we have done differently about your project now that it is all over? 

When we initially began our project we started with the idea of building an ERD that would effectively capture the relevant information for our business but as we went through the process and started creating tables and generating reports more logical ways of connecting the information and fields we would want to gather information on came to light. Because of this if we were to go back and start all over we would want to have a better understanding of the insights we would want to gain from our reports while creating the ERD and tables so that attributes could be added in a more effective manner. 

4. What suggestion would we give to improve the learning process via this project? Or anything we think should be incorporated as an additional step to this project? 

We would suggest having more time to discuss the ERD and the swimlane diagram together. Through discussion, we would learn from the othersâ€™ thoughts and know whether both diagrams make sense and where the gaps are.
